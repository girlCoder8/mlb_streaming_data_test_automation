# Examples for UAT Testing 

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) focuses on validating that the system meets the business requirements and is ready for use by end-users.

## UAT Test Cases:
1. ### User Authentication:
   Objective: Ensure users can successfully log in.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Navigate to the login page.
   - Enter valid credentials (username and password).
   - Verify successful login and access to the streaming platform.
2. ### Streaming Video Playback:
   Objective: Confirm that users can watch streaming MLB videos.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Navigate to the MLB streaming page.
   - Select a live or recorded video.
   - Verify that the video starts playing without interruptions.
   Check for video quality and responsiveness.
3. ### Interactive Features:
   Objective: Ensure interactive features (e.g., comments, reactions) work as expected.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Access a live-streaming event.
   - Interact with features like comments or reactions.
   - Verify that user interactions are displayed in real-time.
4. ### Content Search and Navigation:
   Objective: Confirm that users can easily find and navigate to desired content.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Use the search functionality to find specific teams, players, or events.
   - Verify that search results are accurate and relevant.
   - Navigate to different sections of the platform and ensure smooth transitions.
5. ### User Preferences and Settings:
   Objective: Validate that users can customize their preferences and settings.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Access the user profile or settings page.
   - Modify preferences such as language, notification settings, or video quality.
   - Confirm that changes are saved and reflected in the user experience.
6. ### Account Management:
   Objective: Ensure users can manage their accounts effectively.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Update account information (e.g., email, password).
   - Verify that account changes are applied.
   - Test the password recovery/reset process.
7. ### Cross-Browser Compatibility:
   Objective: Confirm that the streaming platform works across different browsers.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Access the platform using different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
   - Verify that all features and functionalities work consistently.
8. ### Mobile Responsiveness:
   Objective: Validate the responsiveness of the platform on mobile devices.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Access the platform using various mobile devices (phones, tablets).
   - Confirm that the layout adjusts appropriately, and all features are accessible.
9. ### Error Handling:
   Objective: Test how the system handles errors and edge cases.
   <br>Test Steps:
   - Submit invalid login credentials and verify the error message.
   - Attempt to access unavailable content and check error handling.
10. ### Performance Testing:
    Objective: Assess the platform's performance under varying conditions.
    <br>Test Steps:
    - Simulate concurrent users accessing the platform.
    - Measure and monitor response times during peak usage.
    - Verify that the system remains responsive and stable.
    UAT Execution Guidelines:
    - Collaboration with Stakeholders:

Note: Involve key stakeholders in the UAT process to gather feedback and ensure alignment with business goals.

### Test Data Preparation:
### Best Practices:
- [x] Use real-world data whenever possible to simulate actual user scenarios.
Documentation:

- [x] Document test cases, expected results, and any deviations observed during testing.
Feedback Collection:

- [x] Encourage end-users to provide feedback on their overall experience and any issues encountered.
Regression Testing:

- [x] Execute regression tests to ensure that new features or changes do not impact existing functionality.
Usability Testing:

- [x] Assess the overall usability and intuitiveness of the platform from an end-user perspective.
Accessibility Testing:

- [x] Verify that the application complies with accessibility standards to accommodate users with diverse needs.
Performance Monitoring:

- [x] Monitor system performance during UAT to identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization.
Scalability Testing:

If applicable, simulate an increase in user load to validate the platform's scalability.
Test Environment:

- [x] Ensure that the UAT environment closely mirrors the production environment.
