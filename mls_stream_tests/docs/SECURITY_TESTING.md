# Examples for Security Testing 

### Input Validation:
- [x] Ensure that user inputs, especially those coming from external sources, are properly validated to prevent injection attacks.
### Authentication and Authorization Testing:
- [x] Verify that only authorized users have access to sensitive functionalities and data.
### SSL/TLS Security:
- [x] Check that the application uses secure protocols (HTTPS) and validate SSL/TLS configurations.
### Data Encryption:
- [x] Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted during transmission and storage.
### Session Management:
- [x] Evaluate how sessions are managed, including session timeout, token usage, and secure session storage.
### Error Handling:
- [x] Test how the application handles errors to prevent exposing sensitive information.
### Dependency Scanning:
- [x] Regularly scan and update dependencies, libraries, and frameworks to address known security vulnerabilities.
### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Testing:
- [x] Validate that the application is protected against common web vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.
### Security Headers:
- [x] Check the presence and effectiveness of security headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), etc.
### API Security:
- [x] If applicable, ensure that APIs are secured with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Note: These security testing considerations are essential to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in your MLB streaming application. Regularly update your security tests to address evolving threats and vulnerabilities.
