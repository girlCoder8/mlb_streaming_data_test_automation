7. Offline Functionality:
   Objective: Confirm that essential features work seamlessly when the device is offline.
   Test Cases:
    - [x] Test offline access to previously downloaded content.
    - [x] Verify that users can interact with stored data even without an internet connection.
8. Push Notifications:
   Objective: Test the functionality and behavior of push notifications.
   Test Cases:
    - [x] Confirm that users receive timely and relevant notifications.
    - [x] Verify that tapping on notifications directs users to the correct content.
9. Security Testing:
   Objective: Identify and address security vulnerabilities in the mobile app.
   Test Cases:
    - [x] Test data transmission security (HTTPS).
    - [x] Validate user authentication and authorization processes.
10. Updates and Compatibility:

- **Objective:** Confirm that the app functions correctly in different languages and regions.
- **Test Cases:**
    1. Test language switching within the app.
    2. Verify that localized content is displayed correctly.
15. User Data Privacy:
- **Objective:** Ensure the app complies with data privacy regulations and protects user information.
- **Test Cases:**
    1. Validate secure storage and transmission of user data.
    2. Confirm that user data is appropriately handled and not exposed.
       Execution Guidelines:
       Emulators and Real Devices:

### Best Practices
Use a combination of emulators and real devices for testing to cover a broader range of scenarios.
Mobile Testing Tools:

Utilize mobile testing tools such as Appium, Espresso, or XCUITest for automated testing.
Continuous Integration:

VITAL: Ensure to integrate mobile testing into the continuous integration pipeline for regular and automated testing.
